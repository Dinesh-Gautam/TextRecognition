  "Introduction\nPASSING THE TORCH TO YOU\nThe critical responsibility for the generation you're in is to help pro-\nvide the shoulders, the direction, and the support for those genera-\ntions who come bebind.\n—Gloria Dean Randle Scott\n#g=he shoulders I stand on are those of my mother Frances. She was the one\n%\\2 who made the quality of the food on the family dinner table her most cher-\n. ished responsibility. The aromas of her delicious, imaginative meals, pre-\npared with so much care and love, warmed our home and drew me into the\nkitchen. There I would scrub and shine the pots and pans, just to be near her, in\nhopes of soaking up some of her talent. My mother passed on to me a family legacy,\nas she gave me a priceless education in feminine culinary nurturing that has dom-\ninated my life’s work. I didn’t know then that she’d handed me a torch. When I\nchose to carry it, I passed my philosophy on to millions; without my mother’s influ-\nence, I would never have been able to do the work I do.\n\n[ can see now that I've ignited a similar passion for culinary nurturing in my\nown daughter Lisa. From a young age, her creative interests have mirrored my own\nand gone beyond, into the exciting world of restaurant cuisine, with professional\n\n1\n",

E \"\n\nb An elect.rlc Charge at. re‘st poss.esses only electric field that leads to interaction between the I\nAﬂs.5uﬂ charges i.e. Coulomblcf 1nteraction. In this chapter, study of moving charges will be carried ‘ }\nou.t. The ﬂ(.)W of electric current across g conductor constitute flow of electrons (charge carriers ; ,'\n- being negatlve.ly .charged). As water flows between two points across a channel due to difference |\nof pressure, sm‘ularly the difference of potential across the ends of a conductor causes flow of | 1\n| electrons in a direction of increasing potential. This flow of electrons in a particular direction is\ncalled electric current. Al\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to maintain a steady flow of current in a conductor. f}\n\nAlso, the concept of resistance will be introduced and finally description of basic laws of (\n\nelectricity i.e., Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws will be given.
