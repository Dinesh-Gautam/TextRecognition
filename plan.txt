plan

make refined code and clean code
(use getImageData insted of for loops)

make text recoganised by using enhance text and thickenEdges function (try different variation). Don't use it for the first time when recoganising text.

remove any part which is not text or make it white (after recoganizing get the mean x and y value to determine the height and width in which the text is placed)

..... more will be added.
