[
make text recognized by using enhance text and thickenEdges function (try different variation). Don't use it for the first time when recognized text.

remove any part which is not text or make it white (after recognized get the mean x and y value to determine the height and width in which the text is placed)
](To Be Done Later)

fetch all the images form a folder using nodeJS

save the recognized data with image ID(will be used later when asking question and knowing which image is to be cropped) using nodeJS.

start making q and answering with text which is recognized form the images
after that make user choose that they want the image cropped or full page image
